"""Diamond/Stars delivery provider abstraction.

"manual" is the baseline that always works: the admin tops up the player
by hand (via the official app, site, or whatever supplier they personally
use), then taps "Delivered" in the bot, which notifies the customer.

"fazercards" calls the real FazerCards reseller API (api.fzr.cards) for
products that have been mapped to a real category/offer via
/mapproduct — see bot/services/fazercards.py. Unmapped products (e.g. the
"custom amount" quotes, which don't correspond to any fixed FazerCards
offer) fall back to manual delivery automatically.
